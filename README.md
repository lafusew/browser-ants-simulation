# Vanilla Typescript Starter Kit
### Boilerplate code for Typescript using Parcel bundler.

Start right now, create a new repo and clone this one into it:
```
git clone https://github.com/lafusew/vanilla-typescript-starter.git .
```
If you're using **vscode** make sure you have Eslint and Typescript extension installed to be able to use `.vscode/settings.json` presets.

Edit this part of this `package.json`

```js
{
  "name": "PROJECT_NAME",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "description": "PROJECT_DESCRIPTION"",
  "main": "src/index.ts",
  "author": "AUTHOR",
  // ...
}
```

Run `yarn` to install dev dependencies and then `yarn start` to start developping.

## Stuff to add

- Sass or Less support.
- React/Svelte/Vue branches (or forks) for project that needs one of those frameworks
